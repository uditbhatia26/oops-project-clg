# Quiz Game in C++

This is a simple console-based Quiz Game developed in C++ that demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and file handling. The game allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, score points for correct answers, and save their scores to a file.

## Features
- **Multiple-choice Questions**: Each question has four answer options (A, B, C, D).
- **Scoring System**: Players earn 10 points for each correct answer.
- **Persistent Score Saving**: Scores are saved to a file (`scores.txt`) for future reference.
- **File-based Question Loading**: Questions are loaded from a file (`questions.txt`) and can be easily modified.
